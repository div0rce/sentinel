## Current state

- **Active milestone:** M3 — Retrieval + citation-grounded RAG
- **Status:** in progress (started 2026-05-28)
- **Active branch:** `feat/m03-rag-query`
- **Last completed milestone:** M2 — Ingestion + embedding pipeline (PR #3, merged 2026-05-28)
- **`make check` passing:** baseline green from M2 (57 tests); M3 work in progress
- **Last action:** ran `/start-milestone 03`, switched to `main`, fast-forwarded, created `feat/m03-rag-query`.
- **Next action:** add `retrieval.py` (pgvector cosine top-k); build `llm/` package (Protocol + Claude client + FakeLLM + factory); add `rag.py` with citation-or-refuse policy; add `POST /query` router with Pydantic schemas; wire into `main.py`; add FakeLLM-only tests for ordering, refusal, and citation→chunk mapping.
- **Blockers:** none.

### M3 DoD checklist

- [ ] `POST /query` returns answer + citations for an in-corpus question (manual check with real key).
- [ ] Tests (FakeLLM): retrieval ordering, refusal when unsupported, citation→chunk mapping correctness.

## Decision log
> One line per real decision (architecture choices, library picks, thresholds, **measured eval numbers**).
> Add an ADR under `docs/adr/` for anything architectural.

- 2026-05-28 (M1) — Database vector dimension is canonical at `vector(1536)` via `SCHEMA_EMBEDDING_DIM`, matching the initial migration. Runtime embedding config must match the schema or be validated before insertion in M2; schema dimension changes require a migration.
- 2026-05-28 (M1) — `WorkflowItem.status` persisted as the enum *value* (`needs_review`), not the Python *name* (`NEEDS_REVIEW`), via `SAEnum(values_callable=...)`; matches the SQL enum the migration creates and keeps audit JSONB readable.
- 2026-05-28 (M1) — Repository layer is functional (one module per aggregate, plain functions taking an active `Session`); transaction boundaries are owned by the caller (FastAPI dep, ingestion pipeline). `audit_events` exposes only `append` and read helpers; an introspection test fails on any future mutator.
- 2026-05-28 (M1) — `audit_events.append()` may return the newly inserted ORM row for write flow, but read helpers return immutable detached `AuditEventRead` DTOs so callers cannot mutate or delete audit rows through repository reads.
- 2026-05-28 (M2) — Chunker is pinned to tiktoken's `cl100k_base` encoder so chunk boundaries align with `text-embedding-3-*` (the planned production embedder). Switching providers later will require either re-chunking or accepting that boundaries no longer align with the new tokenizer.
- 2026-05-28 (M2) — `FakeEmbedder` produces deterministic SHA-256-stretched, L2-normalized vectors of `SCHEMA_EMBEDDING_DIM` length. CI runs offline with `EMBEDDINGS_PROVIDER=fake`, satisfying the "no live API calls in CI" constraint without skipping the embedding code path.
- 2026-05-28 (M2) — Ingestion idempotency is keyed on `sha256(canonical_text)`. Whitespace is **not** normalized: a single character difference (including trailing newline) makes two distinct documents. This avoids the "is it the same?" ambiguity but means callers must canonicalize upstream if they want fuzzy idempotency.
- 2026-05-28 (M2) — `OpenAIEmbedder` uses `httpx` directly rather than the OpenAI SDK; the embeddings endpoint is small and stable, and avoiding the SDK saves a transitive dependency. CI does not exercise this provider.
- 2026-05-28 (M2) — Stored chunk text must preserve byte/text provenance by slicing the original source string from `decode_with_offsets()` token spans. The chunker must not store lossy arbitrary token-window decodes.
