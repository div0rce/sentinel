## Current state

- **Active milestone:** M2 — Ingestion + embedding pipeline
- **Status:** in progress (started 2026-05-28)
- **Active branch:** `feat/m02-ingestion`
- **Last completed milestone:** M1 — Data model + migrations (PR #2, merged 2026-05-28)
- **`make check` passing:** baseline green from M1; M2 work in progress
- **Last action:** ran `/start-milestone 02`, switched to `main`, fast-forwarded, created `feat/m02-ingestion`.
- **Next action:** add tiktoken dep; build `embeddings/` package (Protocol + FakeEmbedder + OpenAI provider + factory); add `chunking.py`; build idempotent `ingest.py` with CLI; commit a synthetic corpus and a generator script; add tests; wire `make seed` (with `EMBEDDINGS_PROVIDER=fake`) into CI.
- **Blockers:** none.

### M2 DoD checklist

- [ ] `make seed` ingests the synthetic corpus; `chunks` populated with embeddings.
- [ ] Tests: chunking is deterministic; re-ingesting the same document creates no duplicates.
- [ ] No live embedding calls in CI (FakeEmbedder used).

## Decision log
> One line per real decision (architecture choices, library picks, thresholds, **measured eval numbers**).
> Add an ADR under `docs/adr/` for anything architectural.

- 2026-05-28 (M1) — Database vector dimension is canonical at `vector(1536)` via `SCHEMA_EMBEDDING_DIM`, matching the initial migration. Runtime embedding config must match the schema or be validated before insertion in M2; schema dimension changes require a migration.
- 2026-05-28 (M1) — `WorkflowItem.status` persisted as the enum *value* (`needs_review`), not the Python *name* (`NEEDS_REVIEW`), via `SAEnum(values_callable=...)`; matches the SQL enum the migration creates and keeps audit JSONB readable.
- 2026-05-28 (M1) — Repository layer is functional (one module per aggregate, plain functions taking an active `Session`); transaction boundaries are owned by the caller (FastAPI dep, ingestion pipeline). `audit_events` exposes only `append` and read helpers; an introspection test fails on any future mutator.
- 2026-05-28 (M1) — `audit_events.append()` may return the newly inserted ORM row for write flow, but read helpers return immutable detached `AuditEventRead` DTOs so callers cannot mutate or delete audit rows through repository reads.
